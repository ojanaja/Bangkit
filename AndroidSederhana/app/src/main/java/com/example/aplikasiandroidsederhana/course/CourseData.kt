But creating code that is easy to understand, manage, and develop is a real challenge, even for experienced programmers. Depending on the paradigm used, there are solutions available to solve this problem. In the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, there is a known set of principles called SOLID, which aims to make code easier to understand, manage, and develop. Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob), an engineer and instructor from America, introduced SOLID in his paper entitled Design Principle and Design Pattern in 2000.\n" +
